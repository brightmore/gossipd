#What is Gossipd?#
Gossipd is an implementation of [MQTT 3.1](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html) broker written in Go. MQTT is an excellent protocal for mobile messaging. Facebook built the new Facebook Messager based on MQTT. 

#Why another broker?#
The main reason I'm writting this is because all major open source MQTT brokers, like [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) didn't balance well between scalability and ease of maintaining.
